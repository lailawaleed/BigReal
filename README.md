# ðŸ“Œ BigReal: Arbitrary Precision Real Number Class

## ðŸš€ Overview
BigReal is a **C++ class** designed to handle **real numbers of arbitrary precision**, overcoming the limitations of standard floating-point types like `float` and `double`.  
It provides accurate arithmetic operations on very large or very small real numbers without losing precision.  
This class is inspired by Javaâ€™s `BigInteger` and `BigDecimal` classes.
